Time Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

The general background of time series forecasting and anomaly detection and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) is described. Two algorithms using GANs are suggested:
Algorithm A (classical GAN approach) and Algorithm B (a modified version of Algorithm
A). The main purpose of the paper is to describe how GANs can be used for Time Series
Prediction and Anomaly Detection, moreover, prove that Algorithm B generally works better
than Algorithm A. Both algorithms are implemented in Python 3 and a conclusion is made
about their performance and a comparison is provided.
